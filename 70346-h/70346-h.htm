  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>A little over ten years ago an Indian living near Keam’s Canyon,
    Arizona, informed Mr T. V. Keam, who for several years had been making
    a collection of Hopi curiosities, that there were two idols in a
    cave near the ruins of the old pueblo of Awatobi. Mr Keam, supposing
    these images to be so ancient that they no longer were used in the
    Hopi ritual, especially as they were reported from a point ten miles
    from the nearest pueblo, visited the place, and brought the idols to
    his store, several miles distant. When the removal of these objects
    became known, it created great consternation among some of the Hopi,
    and a delegation of priests from one of their villages begged Mr Keam
    to restore the figurines to them, stating that they were still used
    in their ceremonies. This request was immediately granted, and the
    two idols were borne away with great reverence by the priests, who
    sprinkled a line of meal on the ground along the trail as they returned
    home. The images, however, have never been returned to their old shrine
    under the Awatobi mesa, but a new fane has been found for them, the
    situation of which is known to no white man.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>From the late Mr A. M. Stephen’s rough sketches, notes, and
    measurements of these images (which the writer has not seen), it
    appears that they are made of cottonwood, the larger one about four
    feet tall, the other five inches shorter. Mr Stephen thought <span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>that they
    represented male and female, and his sketches of them show ground for
    that belief. Each has a well carved head, from which arise two straight
    projections which will be spoken of as horns.</p>

  <p>In his studies of the Hopi Indians the author has several times visited
    the shrine at Awatobi where these objects were once kept, finding it
    a depression in a large bowlder, which was formerly walled up with
    masonry, making a shelf upon which the images stood. The entrance to
    this shrine faces the east, and the bowlder lies a few feet lower down
    on the cliff than the foundation of the old mission church of San
    Bernardino de Awatobi. By interrogating Indians regarding the images,
    he has found that they represent beings called <i>Alósakas</i>, the
    cult of which, once practised at Awatobi, still survives in the rites
    of the modern Hopi pueblos. Many legends concerning <i>Alósaka</i>
    have been collected, but only during the last few years has the author
    witnessed ceremonies connected with their cult. As a result of these
    observations a suggestion in regard to its significance is offered.</p>

  <p>The distinctive symbolic feature of these images is the horns
    (<i>ála</i>) above referred to, from which they take their name. There
    is a priesthood at Walpi called the <i>Aaltû</i> or Horn-men (to whom
    the name <i>Alósaka</i> is also given), who are the special guardians
    of the cult and who perform rites which throw light on its nature.
    These <i>Aaltû</i>, in their personifications of <i>Alósakas</i>, wear
    on their heads close-fitting wicker caps,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on which are mounted two
    large, artificial, curved projections made of buckskin, painted white,
    and resembling horns of the mountain sheep<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which, in certain of
    their actions, the <i>Aaltû</i> imitate.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span></p>

  <p>The three Walpi ceremonies in which we find survivals of the
    <i>Alósaka</i> cult are the Flute, the New-fire, and the Winter
    Solstice, which are especially instructive in a study of its
    significance.</p>

  <h3>Personations of Alósaka as Escorts</h3>

  <p>In the Flute and New-fire ceremonies the role of the personators of
    <i>Alósaka</i> is that of an escort who leads the columns of dancers or
    processions of priests.</p>

  <p>The personation of <i>Alósaka</i> in the Walpi Flute-dance was by a
    member of the <i>Ása</i> clan, who, on the fifth day of the ceremony,
    drew a line of ground corn and made rain-cloud symbols along the path
    by which altar objects were carried from one place to another. He made
    a line of meal across the trail by which one enters Walpi, in order
    to symbolically close it to visitors on the seventh day, when the
    historic reception of the Flute chief by the Bear and Snake chiefs
    was dramatized, and brushed away this meal when the Flute chief was
    invited to enter the pueblo at that time. He also “closed” the trail a
    second time when the Flute priests marched into the pueblo, and brushed
    the meal away as they proceeded. On the last day he led a procession
    of priests to the Sun spring (<i>Táwapa</i>), where a ceremony of
    wading into the water was performed, and escorted it back to Walpi
    on the afternoon of the last day, when the public Flute exercises
    were conducted. He sprinkled a line of meal over which certain sacred
    objects were carried from the Flute altar to the roof of the house, and
    led the priests as they bore these objects from place to place. There
    are only obscure hints regarding the nature of the <i>Alósaka</i> cult
    in these acts.</p>

  <p>In the New-fire ceremonies we find <i>Alósaka</i> filling the role
    of escort, and also that of tyler at the kiva hatches. He escorted
    the public dancers, visited the trails, and drew lines of meal across
    them to prevent strangers from entering the pueblo. He inspected
    these trails from time to time, guarded the ladder while the new fire
    was being kindled, and carried it to the other kivas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span> These duties
    are those of warriors, but <i>Alósaka</i> was not armed, nor is the
    mountain sheep which he represents a probable personation of a warrior.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that there is no <i>Alósaka</i> escort of the
    Flute priests in their public dances at the Middle Mesa, and, judging
    from photographs, it would seem that there is a like absence at Oraibi,
    which may be due to the absence of certain clans. Thus, one of the
    chiefs of the <i>Aaltû</i> or <i>Alósaka</i> society at Walpi belongs
    to the <i>Ása</i> clan of Tanoan extraction limited to the East Mesa.
    The first colonists of this clan were essentially warriors, and their
    performance of escort duty may be a survival of former times.</p>

  <p>As there are two chiefs of equal standing in the <i>Aaltû</i>
    priesthood, one of the <i>Ása</i> and the other of the Bear clan (one
    of the oldest in Walpi), it would seem that there are two phases of the
    cult, and that the function of <i>Alósaka</i> as an escort is distinct
    from an older one common to other Hopi villages.</p>

  <h3>Germinative Element in the Alósaka Cult</h3>

  <p>The germinative element of the <i>Alósaka</i> cult, which we may regard
    as an ancient phase, was introduced into Awatobi and the other Hopi
    pueblos by a group of clans from the far south. These clans, called the
    <i>Patuñ</i>, or Squash, founded the pueblo of Micoñinovi,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where
    the <i>Alósaka</i> cult is now vigorous, and were prominent in Awatobi
    where it was important. There is one episode of the elaborated New-fire
    ceremony which is traced to these southern clans; this concerns a
    figurine, called <i>Talatumsi</i>, kept in a shrine under the cliffs of
    Walpi and especially reverenced by the <i>Aaltû</i> or <i>Alósaka</i>
    priests.</p>

  <p>In the elaborated New-fire rites, called the <i>Naácnaiya</i>,
    just after the fire has been kindled by frictional methods in the
    <i>Moñkiva</i> before a man personating the Fire-god, one of the
    <i>Aaltû</i> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>brought into the pueblo, from the shrine in which it is
    kept, the image of <i>Talatumsi</i> wrapped in a white blanket with
    prayer-sticks in its girdle. This was set on the kiva hatches, one
    after another, where it remained several days; rites were performed
    about it, during which it was sprinkled with meal in prayer, and later
    reverentially carried by the <i>Aaltû</i> back to its shrine, where
    it was set in position to remain until the next quadrennial ceremony.
    This image is supposed to represent, not <i>Alósaka</i>, but the bride
    of <i>Alósaka</i>, the maternal parent of the <i>Aaltû</i> society
    about whom cluster so many folktales. She is the cultus heroine of
    that society,—one of their ancestors,—and her effigy is brought into
    the pueblo in November, every four years, by one of their number, just
    as we may suppose the images of <i>Alósaka</i> were brought into old
    Awatobi when the New-fire ceremony was celebrated in that ill-fated
    pueblo.</p>

  <p>The Hopi have another shrine at which they worship in the New-fire
    ceremony, but instead of an image this contains a log of silicified
    wood called <i>Tuwapontumsi</i>, “Earth-altar-woman.” Exactly who
    this personage is, the author has not yet discovered, but it is
    instructive to know that among the Hopi totems which he obtained,
    one of the men gave as his signature a figure of a lizard, a circle
    representing the earth, and a horned human figure which was called
    <i>Tuwapontumsi</i>. As this figure recalls that of <i>Alósaka</i>,
    and as the shrine of the being it represents is visited at the same
    time as that of <i>Talatumsi</i> by priests guided by <i>Alósaka</i>,
    it is not impossible that <i>Tuwapontumsi</i> is connected with the
    <i>Alósaka</i> cult.</p>

  <p>A visit to this shrine was made by the two phallic societies,
    <i>Tataukyamû</i> and <i>Wüwütcimtû</i>, directly after the kindling
    of the new fire in the chief kiva at Walpi. They were led by a man
    personating <i>Alósaka</i>, and after praying at the shrine they
    marched in single file to the site of Old Walpi, on the terrace below
    the present pueblo, and encircled the mounds of this old habitation
    four times, sprinkling prayer-meal as their leader, <i>Alósaka</i>,
    directed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span> This place is called a <i>sípapû</i>, and below it are
    thought to dwell the ancients. The prayers were addressed to the old
    men who have died. “Down below us they dwell,” said an old priest.
    “There the ancients dwell,” said he, patting the ground with his
    foot. “We are now praying to them.” There are many facts which show
    the existence of ancestor worship among the Hopi, but the author
    never heard it stated more clearly by the priests than the night he
    accompanied the phallic societies<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to the ancient site of Walpi in
    the celebration of the New-fire ceremonies in November, 1898.</p>

  <h3>The Bird-man in the Soyáluña</h3>

  <p>One of the most striking features of the rites of the Winter Solstice
    ceremony in the chief kiva is the personation, before an altar, of
    a Bird-man who is thought to represent a solar god. This episode at
    Walpi has been elsewhere described,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but as at Oraibi it immediately
    precedes certain rites directly related to the <i>Alósaka</i> cult, a
    few notes on the personation of the Bird-man in the latter pueblo will
    be introduced.</p>

  <p>About 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the day called <i>Tótokya</i>, the chief day
    of all great ceremonies, this man, preceded by two others, passed into
    the kiva, his entrance being announced by balls of meal thrown through
    the hatchway upon the floor, falling near the fireplace. The two men
    seated themselves, one on each side of the ladder, which was grasped
    in one arm. The Bird-man who followed had his face painted white, and
    in his mouth was a whistle with which he continually imitated the call
    of a bird, probably the eagle. He <span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>first stood on the upraise in the
    floor, called the spectators’ part, then squatted on the floor near
    the right pole of the ladder. He carried feathers in his hands,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
    and, moving his arms up and down, imitated the motion of wings, as if
    flapping them like a bird.</p>

  <p>While he was performing these avian movements, the spectators sang
    a stirring song and the Bird-man slowly advanced to the middle of
    the room, imitating the gait of a bird and crouching in a squatting
    attitude. The motion of the wings and the bird-cries continued, the
    personator now and then raising his arms and letting them fall with a
    quivering motion. Once in the middle of the room he laid the feathers
    on the floor and remained there for a short time without moving. He
    then arose and danced for a long time, accompanied by a woman who held
    in one hand an ear of corn which she gracefully waved back and forth.
    She followed the Bird-man as he moved from place to place, and at the
    close of the dance took her seat near the right wall of the kiva where
    she sat before the Bird-man entered the room.</p>

  <p>After the woman had taken her seat, the Bird-man continued the wing
    movements with his arms, stretching them at full length and then
    drawing them back to his body. He then proceeded to a pile of sand
    in a corner near the upraise; taking pointed sticks or reeds in his
    hand and halting before this mound of sand, he threw first one, then
    another, of the sticks into the sand, all the time imitating a bird in
    the movements of his body and simulating the bird-calls with a whistle.
    He then went to the <i>Soyáluña</i> woman who had danced with him;
    squatting before her, he uttered the strange bird-calls, and, making
    a pass, raised the small sticks which he carried from her feet to her
    head several times. He then returned to the mound of sand and again
    shot the sticks into it, after which he returned to the woman. This was
    repeated several times. The bird personator then returned to the middle
    of the kiva, before the altar, and, taking a bow and some arrows,
    danced for some time, while all the assembled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>priests sang in chorus.
    As the Bird-man danced, he raised the bow, fitted an arrow to it, faced
    the north, and drew the bowstring as if to shoot. This was repeated six
    times, the performer pointing the arrow to the cardinal directions in
    prescribed sinistral sequence.</p>

  <p>At the close of this part of the performance the songs ceased and the
    Bird-man took a seat before the altar, while a priest at his right
    lit a conical pipe and blew through it, on the body of the Bird-man,
    clouds of tobacco smoke. This smoke was not taken into the mouth, but
    the smoker placed the larger end between his lips, and blew through
    the tube, causing the smoke to issue from a small hole at the pointed
    end.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> After prayers by one or more of the priests, the Bird-man again
    danced before the altar, at the same time imitating the movements of
    wings with his arms and bird-calls with a whistle in his mouth. He then
    left the room and the calls could be heard as he went outside.</p>

  <p>This proceeding is interpreted as a symbolic dramatization or
    representation of the fertilization of the earth, and is an example
    of highly complicated sympathetic magic by which nature powers of sky
    and earth are supposed to be influenced.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The Bird-man, called
    <i>Kwátaka</i> or <i>Kwátoka</i>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is an old war-god, and possibly a
    sun god, the return of whom the Winter Solstice ceremony commemorates.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span></p>

  <p>The evidence that the Bird-man personates a sun or sky god is derived
    mainly from morphological symbolism, and in support of the theory there
    are here introduced a figure of the most common Hopi sun symbol, also
    representations of dolls of a sun god, and <i>Kwátaka</i> whom the
    Bird-man personates.</p>

  <p>The common sun emblem (<a href="#i011">plate <span class="allsmcap">XXV</span></a>, <i>a</i>) is a round disk
    with a woven corn-husk margin in which are inserted feathers of
    the eagle radiating at all angles. From the four quadrants project
    sticks—the ends of an equal-armed cross. This disk has the following
    design painted upon it: The upper part is separated from the lower by
    a horizontal line, and the space above is divided into two parts by a
    perpendicular line, while the mouth is represented in the lower space
    by an hourglass-shaped figure. Two marks represent eyes. This disk is
    worn on the backs of men personating the sun, in many rites, and is
    found painted on the screens used in the <i>Palülükoñti</i> ceremony.
    It is the ordinary sun symbol in Hopi pictography.</p>

  <p>Many conventional modifications of this symbol are common. The painted
    design is often omitted and the disk reduced to a circle, while
    the feathers are dropped, or concentrated in clusters in the four
    quadrants. In the sand picture of <i>Powalawû</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the sun symbol is
    made of concentric zones of sand of different colors with arrow-shaped
    extensions in the four quadrants. Again, the circle may be absent, when
    the four extensions in its quadrants remain, forming a cross called a
    <i>tokpela</i>. This highly conventionalized form of the sun is often
    found depicted on shields as a warrior’s symbol.</p>

  <p>Thus, while the equal-armed cross sometimes becomes a sun symbol, this
    by no means implies that the cross may not also have other meanings.
    The signification of symbols depends on association, and the simple
    emblem described may have an entirely different meaning in other
    associations. There is no more constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span> decoration used in the
    ornamentation of ancient Hopi pottery than the cross, yet to interpret
    this simple figure as invariably a sun symbol would be absurd, for it
    may mean the sky, the four world-quarters, the four winds, the sun, or
    a star; or it may be employed simply as an insignificant decorative
    motive. Such simple designs as the cross, the circle, or the triangle,
    in primitive symbolism, may often be regarded as simply qualitative
    and are so used in pictography, their true meaning in specific
    cases depending on their association with other figures. In certain
    associations a circle is a sun symbol, in others an earth symbol;
    an equal-armed cross with a figure of a rapacious bird sometimes
    represents the sun, in other instances the four cardinal points, which,
    with the Hopi, are purely terrestrial directions or positions on the
    horizon.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Returning to the common symbol of the sun, or the disk with painted
    design and radiating peripheral eagle feathers, we find on comparing
    it with the symbolism of the head of a sun god (<a href="#i011">plate <span class="allsmcap">XXV</span></a>,
    <i>b</i>), a close similarity. Among the features common to both are
    the markings on the upper half of the face, the radiating feathers,
    and the cross extensions. The marks on the sun disk, indicating eyes,
    are here replaced by balls, but of greater importance in future
    comparison, the mouth or double triangle is represented by a curving
    beak. The reason for the substitution of this form of mouth is apparent
    in a comparison with the head of the doll of <i>Kwátaka</i> (<a href="#i011">plate
    <span class="allsmcap">XXV</span></a>, <i>c</i>), where a bird’s head, wings, and tail are
    all represented. The symbolic design on the body of this bird doll
    is strictly comparable with those on the two sun symbols previously
    mentioned. The radiating feathers are replaced by tail and wings,
    while the head is suggested by the curved beak of the second symbol.
    A comparison of these three figures leads to the belief that they are
    three different sun symbols.</p>

  <p>The fact that the last is called <i>Kwátaka</i>, and that the Bird-man
    in <i>Soyáluña</i> was given the same name, supports the theory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span> that
    the latter is a solar god. In his performance he does not, to be sure,
    wear a mask with solar symbols, but he imitates a bird in action and
    voice. He is a patron of warriors, like the sun; he is the first god
    to return, and the <i>Soyáluña</i> is a celebration to cause the sun
    to return. The eagle or a raptorial bird is the sun bird; the sun
    fertilizes the earth, and the ceremonial acts of the Bird-man at the
    Winter Solstice dramatize fertilization. In short, the conclusion to
    which studies of the ceremonial acts of the Bird-man, reinforced by
    those of comparative symbolism, have led me, is that the Bird-man
    personates the sun or a solar deity.</p>

  <h3>Ceremony with the Alósaka Screen</h3>

  <p>After the bird personator had retired, a short interval elapsed,
    all the spectators of the previous rites remaining seated. A screen
    was then handed through the kiva hatchway and propped upright near
    the fireplace with blocks of clay and stones. This screen (<a href="#i015">plate
    <span class="allsmcap">XXVI</span></a>) was estimated to be between four and five feet long,
    by about three feet wide, and was decorated on the side turned toward
    the fireplace and the raised floor of the kiva. The entire middle of
    the screen was occupied by a picture of <i>Alósaka</i>, identical with
    that on the sun-shield used in the Walpi <i>Soyáluña</i>.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The head
    of this figure bore two curved horns, with two fan-shaped lateral
    attachments; the chin was painted black; in the right hand an ear of
    corn was represented, and in the left a <i>moñkohu</i> or whitened slab
    of wood with attached feathers.</p>

  <p>A triple rain-cloud symbol was depicted on the screen above the head of
    the <i>Alósaka</i> figure, and to the left were four parallel bars with
    a vertical row of four dots. In the lower left-hand corner there was a
    symbolic picture of the sun, and on the right side of <i>Alósaka</i>
    appeared an elongated figure which possibly may have represented
    a sprouting seed. To each side of the screen were attached four
    artificial flowers, and to the upper edge a number of hoops covered
    with raw cotton, possibly representing snow. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>A conventional symbol
    of corn was drawn on the lower part of the screen, and the surface was
    covered with various seeds, as corn, beans, etc., fastened with clay.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i015">
    <div class="attr">PL. XXVI</div>

    <div class="attl">Drawn by Mary M. Leighter</div>
    <figcaption class="caption">SCREEN OF THE ALÓSAKA</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The rites performed before this screen were of a very simple nature,
    and one of the most important was the scraping of the seeds from the
    lower part into a tray after certain prayers and other observances. To
    the seeds in the basket was added a small quantity of raw cotton taken
    from the top of the screen, which was then carried out of the kiva.</p>

  <p>The ceremony before the screen is interpreted as a prayer to
    <i>Alósaka</i> for rain, snow, fertilization of seed, and abundant
    harvests, symbolized by the figures on it and the rites performed
    before it. These ceremonies are very appropriately introduced in
    connection with those of the Rain-cloud people, since both came from
    the south and were brought by related clans.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

  <h3>Ceremony with the Alósaka Shield</h3>

  <p>In the Walpi variant of the <i>Soyáluña</i> or Winter Solstice
    ceremony, we have not as yet observed a ceremony with the
    <i>Alósaka</i> figure comparable with that with the screen just
    described; but there is a shield upon which is painted an almost
    identical figure of <i>Alósaka</i>.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The nature of the rites in
    which this shield is used is imperfectly known, and the character of
    the <i>Alósaka</i> worship in the pueblos of the Middle Mesa is yet to
    be investigated.</p>

  <h3>Pictures of Alósaka</h3>

  <p>The symbolism of <i>Alósaka</i> is shown in a rude drawing made by
    one of the Hopi to illustrate a legend, and it represents this being
    on a rainbow, on which he is said to have traveled from his home in
    the San Francisco mountains to meet an Awatobi maid. Above the figure
    of <i>Alósaka</i> is represented the sun, which is drawn also on the
    screen above <span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>described, for <i>Alósaka</i> is intimately associated
    with the sun, as are all the other horned gods, <i>Ahole</i>,
    <i>Calako</i>, <i>Tuñwup</i>, and the <i>Natackas</i>. An interesting
    detail of the symbolism of this picture of the sun is the crescents
    under the eyes, which are found also on dolls representing the mother
    of the gods, <i>Hahaiwüqti</i>, an Earth-goddess of first importance.
    The personators of <i>Alósaka</i> paint a white crescent under the left
    eye.</p>

  <p>There is good authority for the belief that the conventional symbol
    of <i>Alósaka</i> is a profile view of a budding squash-blossom—a
    central bud and two lateral leaves. When this symbol becomes highly
    conventionalized, or made of rectangular instead of curved lines, it
    consists of a straight line with a triangle on each side, and is then
    the same symbol of generation that is painted with red iron oxide on
    the breast, arms, and thighs of the two phallic societies in the public
    New-fire ceremony.</p>

  <p>As an idea of the nature of <i>Alósaka</i> may be discovered from
    morphological symbolism, let us examine the figures of a few of the
    horned “gods” in the Hopi Olympus.</p>

  <p>The first group of horn-headed gods to which reference may be made are
    the pictures found on altars in the ceremonies called <i>Nimán</i>
    and <i>Powamû</i>. At Walpi these pictures are said to represent
    <i>Tuñwupkatcina</i>,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> a name which may be of Tanoan origin. Figures
    of <i>Tuñwup</i> have two lateral horns on the head, to the tips of
    which representations of feathers are sometimes appended. On the top
    of the head, between these two horns, there is represented a crest of
    radiating feathers, and on the forehead a broadheaded arrow which is
    sometimes modified to resemble the symbolism on the face of the figures
    of the sun painted on disks.</p>

  <p>The <i>Tuñwup</i> type of horned gods includes the <i>Calako-taka</i>,
    <i>Natacka</i>, and one or two others. The mask of <i>Ahole</i>, who
    flogs the children during the <i>Powamû</i> celebration, has the same
    two lateral horns and representation of radiating feathers over the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>crown of the head, but instead of sagittaform marks on the forehead
    there is a colored band from ear to ear across the face, as shown in
    <a href="#i015">plate <span class="allsmcap">XXVI</span></a>, <i>d.</i></p>

  <p>It is probable that these horned gods have close kinship and
    are possibly identical, <i>Ahole</i> being simply a name of the
    personification by a masked man, and <i>Tuñwup</i> that of the picture
    of the same on the altar. The horned <i>Alósaka</i> does not belong to
    this type of horned “gods,” although it has two horns on the head both
    in graven images and in pictures.</p>

  <h3>Myths of Alósaka</h3>

  <p>It will be seen from the preceding account that the <i>Alósaka</i>
    rites are well developed in the ceremonies of the New-fire and Winter
    Solstice, in which the clans from the south who joined the Hopi are
    well represented, or in which religious societies and ceremonial
    paraphernalia brought by the <i>Patuñ</i>, <i>Píba</i>, <i>Pátki</i>,
    and related clans have preeminence. Study of the <i>Alósaka</i> myths
    reveals an explanation of the meaning of this relationship.</p>

  <p>During his valuable studies among the Hopi, the late A. M. Stephen
    obtained an <i>Alósaka</i> legend which is recorded in his notes on the
    Keam collection, and is here quoted with explanations obtained by the
    author since Mr Stephen’s death.</p>

  <p>“At the Red House in the south<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> internecine wars prevailed, and the
    two branches of the <i>Pátki</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> people separated from the other
    Hopi and determined to return to the fatherland in the north.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But
    these two branches were not on the best of terms, and they traveled
    northward by separate routes, the [later settlers of] Micoñinovi<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
    holding to the east of the [later settlers of] Walpi.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span></p>

  <p>“The <i>Pátki</i> traveled north until they came to Little Colorado
    river, and built houses on both its banks.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> After living there many
    years the factional dissensions, which seem to have ever haunted these
    people, again broke out, and the greater portion of them withdrew still
    farther north and built villages the ruins<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of which are still
    discernible not far from the site of the villages their descendants
    inhabit at present.</p>

  <p>“The Squash [Micoñinovi] also trended slowly northward, occupying,
    like all their legendary movements, a protracted period of indefinite
    length—years during which they planted and built homes alternating
    with years of devious travel. They grew lax in the observance of
    festivals, and <i>Muinwû</i> inflicted punishment upon them. He caused
    the water to turn red, and the color of the people also turned red; he
    then changed the water to blue, and the people changed to a similar
    color. The Snow <i>katcina</i> appeared and urged them to return to
    their religion, but they gave no heed to him, so he left them and took
    away corn. <i>Muinwû</i> then sent <i>Palülükoñ</i>,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who killed
    rabbits and poured their blood in the springs and streams, and all the
    water was changed to blood and the people were stricken with a plague.
    They now returned to their religious observances, and danced and sang,
    but none of the deities would listen to them.</p>

  <p>“A horned <i>katcina</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> appeared to the oldest woman and told her
    that on the following morning the oldest man should go out and procure
    a root, and that she and a young virgin of her clan should eat it.
    After a time she (the old woman) would give <span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>birth to a son who would
    marry the virgin, and their offspring would redeem the people. The old
    woman and the virgin obeyed the <i>katcina</i>, and the former gave
    birth to a son who had two horns upon his head. The people would not
    believe that the child was of divine origin; they called it a monster
    and killed it.</p>

  <p>“After this all manner of distressing punishments were inflicted upon
    them, and wherever they halted the grass immediately withered and
    dried. Their wanderings brought them to the foot of the San Francisco
    mountains, where they dwelt for a long time, and at that place the
    virgin gave birth to a daughter who had a little knob on each side of
    her forehead. They preserved this child, and when she had grown to be
    a woman, the horned <i>katcina</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> appeared and announced to her
    that she would give birth to horned twins, who would bring rain and
    remove the punishment from their people. This woman was married, and
    the twins, a boy and a girl, were born; but she concealed their divine
    origin, fearing they would be destroyed.</p>

  <p>“The <i>Patuñ</i> [Squash]<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> now moved to the Little Colorado where
    they built houses and met some of the <i>Pátki</i> people to whom
    they related their distresses. A wise man of the <i>Pátki</i> came
    over to them, and on seeing the twins at once pronounced them to be
    the <i>Alósaka</i>. They had no horns up to this time, but as soon as
    this announcement was made, their horns became visible and the twins
    then spoke to the people and said that it had been ordained that they
    were to be unable to help their people until the people themselves
    discovered who they were. The <i>Patuñ</i> were so enraged to think
    that the <i>Alósaka</i> had been with them, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>unknown so many years,
    that they killed them, and still greater sufferings ensued.</p>

  <p>“They again repented, and carved two stone images of the <i>Alósaka</i>
    which they painted and decked with feathers and sought to propitiate
    the mother. She was full of pity for her people, and prayed to the
    Sky-god<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to relieve them. A period elapsed in which their sufferings
    were in great measure abated.</p>

  <p>“The <i>Patuñ</i> then sought to join the <i>Pátki</i> clans, but the
    <i>Pátki</i> would not permit this, and compelled them to keep east of
    Awatobi.</p>

  <p>“Many ruins of phratry and family houses of the <i>Patuñ</i> people
    exist on the small watercourses north of the Puerco at various
    distances eastward from the present village of Walpi. The nearest are
    almost fifteen miles, the farthest about fifty miles.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

  <p>“Their wandering course was now stayed. When they essayed to move
    farther eastward, a nomadic hunting race who occupied that region
    besought them not to advance farther. Their evil notoriety had
    preceded them, and the nomads feared the malificent influence of
    their neighborhood. It would seem, however, that instead of hostile
    demonstrations the nomads entered into a treaty with them, offering to
    pay tribute of venison, roots, and grass-seeds, if they would abstain
    from traversing and blighting their land, to which the <i>Patuñ</i>
    agreed.</p>

  <p>“But these unfortunate wretches were soon again embroiled in factional
    warfare which finally involved all the Hopi, and the stone images of
    the <i>Alósaka</i> were lost or destroyed. Famine and pestilence again
    decimated them, until finally the <i>Alósaka katcina</i> appeared
    to them and instructed them to carve<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>wooden images, but
    threatening them that if these should be lost or destroyed all the
    people would die.”</p>

  <hr class="tb">

  <p>Many other but widely divergent legends exist regarding <i>Alósaka</i>,
    a number of which are associated with the pueblo of Awatobi, which was
    formerly one of the most populous Hopi towns. At one time this village
    experienced drouth and famine, and <i>Alósaka</i>, from his home in the
    San Francisco mountains, observed the trouble of the people. Disguised
    as a youth he visited Awatobi and became enamored with a maiden of that
    town. Several times he visited her, but no one knew whence he came or
    whither he went, for his trail no one could follow. The parents of the
    girl at last discovered that he came on the rainbow, and recognized him
    as a divine being. The children of this maid were horned beings, or
    <i>Alósakas</i>, but their identity was not at first recognized.</p>

  <p>Like all the cultus heroes, <i>Alósaka</i> is said, in legends, to
    have been miraculously born of a virgin. His father was the Sun, his
    mother an Earth-goddess, sometimes called a maiden. Like many gods, he
    traveled on the rainbow; he lived at Tawaki, the house of his father,
    the Sun, or the San Francisco mountains.</p>

  <p>It would seem from all these stories that the <i>Alósaka</i> cult was
    vigorous in Awatobi, the ill-fated pueblo where the zealous Padre
    Porras lost his life in 1633, and that it was of southern origin,
    having been introduced into Awatobi by one of the phratries from the
    south which lived in the now ruined pueblos on the Little Colorado.
    The most complicated survival of the <i>Alósaka</i> cultus is to
    be expected in the Middle Mesa pueblos, because the phratry which
    introduced it founded some of these pueblos<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and still survives
    there. The result of an examination of many <i>Alósaka</i> myths would
    seem to be a conclusion that he is a cultus hero of clans which came
    from the south.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span></p>

  <h3>Totemic Aspect of Alósaka</h3>

  <p>The <i>Alósaka</i> cult may be regarded as another form of that totemic
    ancestor worship which appears in all Hopi mythology and ritual. The
    male and female <i>Alósakas</i> are supposed to be ancestors of a cult
    society called the <i>Aaltû</i>, and are represented symbolically in
    the ritual by graven images, pictures, or personations by men. The name
    <i>Alósaka</i> is simply a sacerdotal name used in this society, but
    it is applied to a similar conception found in the worship of other
    societies under other names.</p>

  <p>In the Snake-Antelope societies of the Hopi the male and female
    parents are called <i>Tcüa-tiyo</i> (Snake-youth) and <i>Tcüa-mana</i>
    (Snake-maid), which beings are personated in the secret exercises of
    the Snake dance by a boy and a girl appropriately clothed.</p>

  <p>In the Flute ceremony the cult society ancestors are called the
    <i>Leñya-tiyo</i> (Flute-youth) and <i>Leñya-mana</i> (Flute-maid), who
    are represented symbolically by images on the altars and by a boy and
    two girls in the public exhibition.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Lalakonti</i> ceremony these two ancestral personages are
    represented in a symbolic way by images on the altar and by sand
    pictures on the floor, and by a man and two girls in the public dance.
    These personages are called by the <i>Lalakonti</i> society the
    <i>Lakone-taka</i> and the <i>Lakone-manas</i> respectively.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Mamzrautû</i> society they are called the <i>Marau-taka</i>
    and the <i>Marau-manas</i>, and are symbolically represented on the
    altar by figurines and in the public dance by a boy and a maid called
    the <i>Palahiko-mana</i> whose headdress with symbolic clouds and
    squash blossoms so closely resembles that of <i>Calako-mana</i>, or the
    Corn-maid,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that it is difficult to distinguish the two.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span></p>

  <p>In the great <i>katcina</i> cult these two personages are called
    <i>Anwucnoshotaka</i> and <i>Hahaiwuqti</i>, or “Man of all the Crow
    clans,” and “Mother of <i>katcinas</i>,” respectively; but as this
    cult is very complex in the East Mesa towns, and is celebrated by many
    amalgamated cult societies, there are various other names for these two
    ancestors.</p>

  <p>It is instructive to consider somewhat more in detail this aspect of
    the Hopi <i>katcina</i> cult in the two great characteristic festivals
    called <i>Powamû</i> and <i>Nimán</i>.</p>

  <p>Reviewing the Hopi calendar it is found that <i>katcina</i> worship
    appears in ceremonies from December to July, inclusive, and while none
    of the festivals between July and December is a true <i>katcina</i>,
    the majority of those during the remainder of the year bear this name.
    As expressed by the Hopi priests, the <i>Nimán</i> ceremony celebrates
    the departure of the <i>katcinas</i> from the pueblos, to which they
    do not return for about six months. This <i>Nimán</i> (“Departure”)
    ceremony of the <i>katcinas</i> is celebrated in July, and no
    <i>katcinas</i> are personated in the Hopi pueblos until December.
    The time of the return of these supernaturals is not as distinct as
    that of their departure, and they may be said to straggle back in the
    December and January rites; but their return in force takes place in
    the February ceremony called <i>Powamû</i> which is made up wholly of
    characteristic <i>katcina</i> exhibitions.</p>

  <p>It is of some interest to determine the month of the return, for there
    are <i>katcina</i> personations in December (<i>Soyáluña</i>) and
    during the January moon, and it may be held that their appearance in
    the former proves that the advent of these worthies occurs in the month
    named. The chief participants in the December rite (and the same may
    be said of the January ceremony) are not distinctive <i>katcinas</i>,
    or rather there are other ceremonies not belonging to this cult in
    their composition, and no special distinctive <i>katcina</i> altars are
    erected. In the <i>Powamû</i>, however, there is a true <i>katcina</i>
    altar which is essentially the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span> same as that set up in the <i>Nimán</i>
    when the <i>katcinas</i> leave the pueblo. <i>Powamû</i> may thus be
    regarded as the official celebration of the return, and from that
    time to July these personages dominate the ritual. But the rites of
    intervening moons are not all necessarily pure <i>katcinas</i>, even
    if <i>katcinas</i> participate in them. Thus, in the March ceremony,
    <i>Palülükoñti</i> (<i>Unkwanti</i>), they are again subordinate. This
    is not a pure <i>katcina</i>, but that of another cult into which
    they have straggled or to which they have been added in the course
    of evolution. There are only two great <i>katcina</i> celebrations,
    <i>Powamû</i> and <i>Nimán</i>, both controlled by the <i>katcina</i>
    chief, both with a true <i>katcina</i> altar, both free from other Hopi
    cults.</p>

  <p>Some of the differences between the <i>Powamû</i> at Walpi and
    the other Hopi pueblos are due to the introduction of masked
    personifications at Walpi which are absent elsewhere. This may be
    explained as follows: Near Walpi there are two other pueblos—one
    Tanoan, the other peopled by descendants of Tanoan clans, neither of
    which has exerted an influence on the other pueblos. These Tanoan
    colonists have brought their own <i>katcinas</i> to the East Mesa of
    Tusayan, and while they possess no altar of this cult they contribute
    their distinctive <i>katcinas</i> to the Walpi <i>Powamû</i>. In the
    January ceremony they do the same, and while the Walpi priests are
    celebrating in that month a true Hopi Flute or Snake rite, Hano and
    Sitcomovi contribute masked <i>katcinas</i> which complicate the
    ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Hence the <i>Powamû</i> rites at Walpi became more
    complicated than those performed elsewhere at the same time, because
    of the proximity of two pueblos in which there are variations in the
    <i>katcina</i> cult that are peculiar to them; and as it is probable
    that the <i>katcina</i> rites in other pueblos have not been affected
    by <i>Ása</i> and Hano clans, we should expect to find in them a less
    complex presentation of the rites of the <i>katcina</i> cult.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span></p>

  <p>This is also in accordance with tradition, for the <i>Honani</i> clans,
    which introduced the <i>katcina</i> cult from Kicuba, went first
    to Oraibi, from which pueblo the cult was distributed to the other
    pueblos. The Walpi <i>katcina</i> altar is simple as compared with
    that at Oraibi; it has no figurines because it is derivative, and the
    same fact may explain why Walpi has but one <i>Powamû</i> altar while
    Oraibi has several. The Walpi <i>katcina</i> altar is simpler than that
    of Oraibi,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> because derivative, but the <i>katcina</i> personations
    in this pueblo are more numerous and varied because the <i>Ása</i> and
    other Tanoan clans have contributed many new forms.</p>

  <p>If we separate from the Walpi <i>Powamû</i> the elements introduced by
    <i>Ása</i> and Hano clans, we find in it the same personages as in the
    Oraibi celebration—<i>Ahole</i>, a Sun-god who flogs the children;
    the <i>katcina</i> cultus hero; <i>Hahaiwuqti</i>, the old woman, and
    <i>Eototo</i>. The last mentioned, a cultus hero of the <i>Kokop</i>
    people and a tutelary god of Sikyatki,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> was an early addition to
    the Walpi ritual before the <i>Powamû</i> was celebrated. He was
    historically the first <i>katcina</i> to come to the pueblo, as he
    now leads the procession of masked priests in their dramatization of
    their advent and exit. Under the name <i>Masauuh</i> he invaded the
    Snake rites, and as <i>Eototo</i> he became a masked personage in the
    <i>Powamû</i> and the <i>Nimán</i> when these ceremonies were added to
    the Walpi ritual.</p>

  <h3><i>Conclusions</i></h3>

  <p>1. There survives in the Hopi ritual a worship of horned beings called
    <i>Alósakas</i>, which once existed at the now ruined pueblo of Awatobi.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span></p>

  <p>2. The purpose of the rites performed in this cult is to cause seeds,
    especially corn, to germinate and grow, and to bring rain to water the
    farms.</p>

  <p>3. The <i>Aaltû</i> priesthood at Walpi, who personate <i>Alósakas</i>,
    perform duties suggestive of those of warriors.</p>

  <p>4. The intimate relationship of <i>Alósaka</i> rites with those of the
    Rain-cloud clans supports legends that they were at one time associated
    and brought from southern Arizona by the Squash people who formerly
    lived with or near the Rain-cloud people along Little Colorado river.</p>

  <p>5. The <i>Alósaka</i> cult is a highly modified form of animal
    totemism, and the <i>Alósaka</i> represents the mountain sheep.</p>

      generation cut out of wood or watermelon rind. The former society was
      introduced from Awatobi by Tapolo, the chief of the Tobacco clan; the
      latter by the Squash clans, now extinct in Walpi. Both these clans
      originally came from the banks of Little Colorado river near Winslow;
      the Tobacco from Cakwabaiyaki, now in ruins at the mouth of Chevlon
      Fork. See <i>Smithsonian Report</i> for 1896.

      of verbally petitioning them. This ceremony comes fairly within a
      definition of religious rites found in Tylor’s <i>Primitive Culture</i>
      (p. 363): “In part they [religious rites] are expressions and symbolic
      performances, the dramatic utterance of religious thought, the gesture
      language of theology.” The interpretation of savage rites as a sign
      language to the gods, and the relation of the altar to primitive
      ceremony have been ably discussed by Major Powell, to whom the writer
      is greatly indebted for a proper understanding of the significance of

      unfortunate girl wore on her head an <i>amalli</i> or “pasteboard”
      miter, surrounded by waving plumes, and her face was painted yellow and
      red, symbolic of the colors of corn. She was called <i>Xalaquia</i>
      (pronounced <i>Shalakia</i>). The Hopi Corn-maid, represented by a
      girl with a rain-cloud tablet on her head and a symbol of an ear

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
